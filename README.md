- 👋 Hi, I’m @krezzia!
- 👀 I’m a rising junior @ UCLA studying Communications with a Computer Science specialization,
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and how it can be applied socially, (currently taking Intermediate Programming C++ & Computer-Mediated Communication)
- 💞️ I’m looking to become more familiar with C++ as a language! Addtionally how understanding code can help me communicate with Product Managers, UX Designers, and overall within product! 
- 📫 How to reach me: krezziabasilio@ucla.edu, I'd love to learn tips on how CS can assist aspiring Product Marketing Managers (like myself!) in the tech space.
